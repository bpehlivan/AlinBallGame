# AllienBallGame
The stupid game i made for my lecture which is full of bugs and has awful user experience.While i was making this game, i was taking a java lecture and i was learning GUI elements.This game was that lecture's project to make practice about what i have learned.
I thought i should store this game,then i decided to put it on github.
sincerely,
